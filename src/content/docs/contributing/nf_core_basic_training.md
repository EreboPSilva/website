# Introduction

## Objectives / Overview (which is better?)

## Prerequisites

## Follow the training videos

This training can be followed either based on this documentation alone, or via a training video hosted on youtube. You can find the youtube video in the Youtube playlist below:

# Using gitpod

For this tutorial we are going to use Gitpod, which is best for first-timers as this platform contains all the programs and data required.
Gitpod will contain a preconfigured Nextflow development environment and has the following requirements:

- A GitHub account
- Web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox)
- Internet connection

Simply click the link and log in using your GitHub account to start the tutorial:

<p class="text-center">
  <a href="https://www.gitpod.io/#https://github.com/nf-core/basic_training" class="btn btn-lg btn-success" target="_blank">
    Launch GitPod
  </a>
</p>

For more information about gitpod, including how to make your own gitpod environement, see the gitpod bytesize talk on youtube (link to the bytesize talk)

## Explore your Gitpod interface

You should now see something similar to the following:

(insert Gitpod welcome image)

- **The sidebar** allows you to customize your Gitpod environment and perform basic tasks (copy, paste, open files, search, git, etc.). Click the Explorer button to see which files are in this repository.
- **The terminal** allows you to run all the programs in the repository. For example, both `nextflow` and `docker` are installed and can be executed.
- **The main window** allows you to view and edit files. Clicking on a file in the explorer will open it within the main window. You should also see the nf-training material browser (<https://training.nextflow.io/>).

To test that the environment is working correctly, type the following into the terminal:

```bash
nextflow info
```

This should come up with the Nextflow version and runtime information:

```
Version: 22.10.4 build 5836
Created: 09-12-2022 09:58 UTC
System: Linux 5.15.0-47-generic
Runtime: Groovy 3.0.13 on OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 17.0.3-internal+0-adhoc..src
Encoding: UTF-8 (UTF-8)
```

## Reopening a Gitpod session

You can reopen an environment from <https://gitpod.io/workspaces>. Find your previous environment in the list, then select the ellipsis (three dots icon) and select Open.

If you have saved the URL for your previous Gitpod environment, you can simply open it in your browser.

Alternatively, you can start a new workspace by following the Gitpod URL: <https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/nextflow-io/training>

If you have lost your environment, you can find the main scripts used in this tutorial in the `nf-training` directory.

## Saving files from Gitpod to your local machine

To save any file from the explorer panel, right-click the file and select Download.

# Explore nf-core/tools

The nf-core/tools package is already installed in the gitpod environment. Now you can check out which pipelines, subworkflows and modules are available via tools.

# Create a pipeline from template

To get started with your new pipeline, run the create command:

```
nf-core create
```

Although you can provide options on the command line, it’s easiest to use the interactive prompts.

### Pipeline git repo

The nf-core create command has made a fully fledged pipeline for you. Before getting too carried away looking at all of the files, note that it has also initiated a git repository:

```
git status
```

It’s actually created three branches for you:

```
git branch
```

Each have the same initial commit, with the vanilla template:

```
git log
```

This is important, because this shared git history with unmodified nf-core template in the TEMPLATE branch is how the nf-core automated template synchronisation works (see the docs for more details).

The main thing to remember with this is that:

When creating a new repository on https://github.com or equivalent, don’t initialise it - leave it bare and push everything from your local clone
Develop your code on either the master or dev branches and leave TEMPLATE alone.

## Run the new pipeline

The new pipeline should run with Nextflow, right out of the box. Let’s try:

```
cd ../
nextflow run nf-core-demo/ -profile test,docker --outdir test_results
```

This basic template pipeline contains already the FastQC and MultiQC modules, which do run on a selection of test data.

## Template code walk through

## Customising the template

In many of the files generated by the nf-core template, you’ll find code comments that look like this:

```
// TODO nf-core: Do something here
```

These are markers to help you get started with customising the template code as you write your pipeline. Editor tools such as Todo tree help you easily navigate these and work your way through them.

## Linting your pipeline

Customising the template is part of writing your new pipeline. However, not all files should be edited - indeed, nf-core strives to promote standardisation amongst pipelines.

To try to keep pipelines up to date and using the same code where possible, we have an automated code linting tool for nf-core pipelines. Running nf-core lint will run a comprehensive test suite against your pipeline:

```
cd nf-core-demo/
nf-core lint
```

Linting tests can have one of four statuses: pass, ignore, warn or fail. For example, at first you will see a large number of warnings about TODO comments, letting you know that you haven’t finished setting up your new pipeline. Warnings are ok at this stage, but should be cleared up before a pipeline release.

Failures are more serious however, and will typically prevent pull-requests from being merged. For example, if you edit CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, which should match the template, you’ll get a pipeline lint test failure:

```
echo "Edited" >> CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
nf-core lint
```

# Adding Modules to a pipeline

## Adding an existing nf-core module

### Identify available nf-core modules

The nf-core pipeline template comes with a few nf-core/modules pre-installed. You can list these with the command below:

```
nf-core modules list local
```

These version hashes and repository information for the source of the modules are tracked in the modules.json file in the root of the repo. This file will automatically be updated by nf-core/tools when you create, remove, update modules.

Let’s see if all of our modules are up-to-date:

```
nf-core modules update
```

You can list all of the modules available on nf-core/modules via the command below but we have added search functionality to the nf-core website to do this too!

```
nf-core modules list remote
```

### Install a remote nf-core module

To install a remote nf-core module from the website, you can first get information about a tool, including the installation command by executing:

```
nf-core modules info [salmon?]
```

Then you can execute the nf-core/tools installation command:

```
nf-core modules install [salmon?]
```

(lots of steps missing here
exercise to add a different module would be nice!
comparison to simple nextflow pipeline from the basic Nextflow training would be nice!)

## Adding a remote module

If there is no nf-core module available for the software you want to include, the nf-core tools package can also aid in the generation of a remote module that is specific for your pipeline. To add a remote module run the following:

```
nf-core modules create
```

Open ./modules/local/demo/module.nf and start customising this to your needs whilst working your way through the extensive TODO comments!

### Making a remote module for a custom script

## Lint all modules

As well as the pipeline template you can lint individual or all modules with a single command:

```
nf-core modules lint --all
```

# Nextflow Schema

All nf-core pipelines can be run with --help to see usage instructions. We can try this with the demo pipeline that we just created:

```
cd ../
nextflow run nf-core-demo/ --help
```

## Working with Nextflow schema

If you peek inside the nextflow_schema.json file you will see that it is quite an intimidating thing. The file is large and complex, and very easy to break if edited manually.

Thankfully, we provide a user-friendly tool for editing this file: nf-core schema build.

To see this in action, let’s add some new parameters to nextflow.config:

```
params {
    demo                       = 'param-value-default'
    foo                        = null
    bar                        = false
    baz                        = 12
    // rest of the config file..

```

Then run nf-core schema build:

```
cd nf-core-demo/
nf-core schema build
```

The CLI tool should then prompt you to add each new parameter.
Here in the schema editor you can edit:

- Description and help text
- Type (string / boolean / integer etc)
- Grouping of parameters
- Whether a parameter is required, or hidden from help by default
- Enumerated values (choose from a list)
- Min / max values for numeric types
- Regular expressions for validation
- Special formats for strings, such as file-path
- Additional fields for files such as mime-type
