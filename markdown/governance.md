## Governance

nf-core is committed to building an open, inclusive, productive and open-source community focused on collecting a curated set of analysis pipelines built using Nextflow.
All community members must comply with the Code of Conduct (CoC) at all times. Anyone with an interest in the project can join the community and contribute.

To help manage the project, nf-core has teams that are made up of community members that oversee core activities. This page describes the structure of the nf-core community, including how governance teams are elected, their responsibilities, and how decisions are made.
