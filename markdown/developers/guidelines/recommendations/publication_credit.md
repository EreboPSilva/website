Pipeline publications should acknowledge the nf-core community (e.g. in an academic journal).

At a minimum, the nf-core community should be thanked in the acknowledgment section ([example](https://peerj.com/articles/10947/#acknowledgements)).

Optionally, the nf-core community can be included as a consortium co-author of the publication ([example](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms232314512)). This route is a good idea when a pipeline has used extensive existing nf-core pipeline infrastructure (e.g. modules) that were written by other members of the community not directly involved in the pipeline itself.

If any members of the nf-core community have provided significant input to the creation of the pipeline, please consider adding them as coauthors on the paper directly.

If in doubt, contact the core team for guidance.
