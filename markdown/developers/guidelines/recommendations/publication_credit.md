Pipeline publications should acknowledge the nf-core community (e.g. in an academic journal).

At a minimum, the nf-core community should be thanked in the acknowledgment section ([example](https://peerj.com/articles/10947/#acknowledgements)).

Optionally, the nf-core community can be included as a consortium co-author of the publication ([example](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms232314512)). This route is a good idea when a pipeline has used extensive existing nf-core pipeline infrastructure (e.g. modules) that were written by other members of the community not directly involved in the pipeline itself.

If in doubt, contact the core team for guidance.
