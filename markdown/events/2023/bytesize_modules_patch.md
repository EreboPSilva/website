# nf-core/bytesize

Join us for our **weekly series** of short talks: **“nf-core/bytesize”**.

Just **15 minutes** + questions, we will be focussing on topics about using and developing nf-core pipelines.
These will be recorded and made available at <https://nf-co.re>
It is our hope that these talks / videos will build an archive of training material that can complement our documentation. Got an idea for a talk? Let us know on the [`#bytesize`](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/bytesize) Slack channel!

## Bytesize: nf-core modules patch

Have you ever wanted to tweak an nf-core module for your own use? No need to copy / paste and lose the benefits of linting and updates, instead try using the magic `nf-core modules patch` command to keep track of your modifications.

Sounds too good to be true? Join us to hear more at this week's bytesize talk with Phil Ewels ([@ewels](https://github.com/ewels))!
