# nf-core/bytesize

Join us for our **weekly series** of short talks: **“nf-core/bytesize”**.

Just **15 minutes** + questions, we will be focussing on topics about using and developing nf-core pipelines.
These will be recorded and made available at <https://nf-co.re>
It is our hope that these talks / videos will build an archive of training material that can complement our documentation. Got an idea for a talk? Let us know on the [`#bytesize`](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/bytesize) Slack channel!

## Bytesize: nf-core/pre-commit

This week, Matthias Hörtenhuber ([@mashehu](https://github.com/mashehu)) is going to explain the use the newly added pre-commit tool added to nf-core/tools. Pre-commits were developed to inspect the snapshot that is about to be committed and helps to check formatting etc. before adding the code to the repository.
