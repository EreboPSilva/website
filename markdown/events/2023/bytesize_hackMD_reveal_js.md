# nf-core/bytesize

Join us for our **weekly series** of short talks: **“nf-core/bytesize”**.

Just **15 minutes** + questions, we will be focussing on topics about using and developing nf-core pipelines.
These will be recorded and made available at <https://nf-co.re>
It is our hope that these talks / videos will build an archive of training material that can complement our documentation. Got an idea for a talk? Let us know on the [`#bytesize`](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/bytesize) Slack channel!

## Bytesize: nf-core/HackMD and reveal.js

HackMD.io is an open source, collaborative Markdown editor, which allows people to share, comment, and collaborate on documents. At nf-core we use HackMD extensively during hackathons and for notekeeping.
This week, Maxime Garcia ([@maxulysse](https://github.com/maxulysse)) will show us how to create Presentation Slides on HackMD using the `reveal.js` integration.
