# Welcome

Join us from March 13-16 2023 for the Nextflow and nf-core training event!

The training is entirely virtual and free and will cover the fundamentals of using Nextflow and nf-core.
While the training will offer something for all skill levels it will be especially useful for those who are new to Nextflow and the nf-core community, or if you are thinking about joining the [nf-core Hackathon](https://nf-co.re/events/2023/hackathon-march-2023) (March 27-29, 2023) for the first time.

Prior knowledge of Nextflow is not required but will make it easier to understand new concepts.

# Learning in your language

Learning something in a non-native language can be difficult. To help make learning Nextflow more accessible, these training sessions will be streamed in five different languages!

- English
- French
- Hindi
- Portuguese
- Spanish

Please contact us if you are familiar with Nextflow and would like to help record training sessions in these or any other language that isn't listed.
